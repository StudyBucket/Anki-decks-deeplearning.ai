These are flashcard decks for the online Deep Learning Specialization.</br>
These decks were created based on notes [mbadry1](https://github.com/mbadry1/DeepLearning.ai-Summary), [ppant](https://github.com/ppant/deeplearning.ai-notes) and the [courses](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) materials.

DeepLearning.ai contains five courses which can be taken on Coursera:

1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning (complete)
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization (complete)
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects (complete)
4. Convolutional Neural Networks (complete)
5. Sequence Models (complete)

You're welcome to use and improve these decks!
